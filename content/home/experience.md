      - Studying the landscape of compactifications of String Theory.

      - Developing novel algorithms in computational geometry and machine learning to efficiently study Calabi-Yau manifolds and compactifications.

      - Lead developer of CYTools, a purpose-built open-source package that allows anyone to easily perform computations exponentially faster than with generic mathematical software.

      - Applying computational tools to the construction of explicit realistic models in string theory.

      - Studied a novel technique to reduce the statistical noise in the computation of 3-point functions in Lattice QCD, facilitating more accurate studies of hadron structure.

      - Explored new methods to store ensembles of gauge field configurations more efficiently, with the aim of reducing the large storage requirements necessary for precision Lattice QCD computations.

      - Assessed prospects for measuring the trilinear Higgs self-coupling constant at the Phase II of the LHC running at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV.

      - Evaluated prospects for measuring the CP phase in the $h\\tau\\tau$ coupling at future $e^-e^+$ colliders and studied the use of novel statistical methods that could offer higher sensitivity.

      - Evaluated and improved methods for searches for charged Higgs bosons at Phase I of the LHC at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV.
