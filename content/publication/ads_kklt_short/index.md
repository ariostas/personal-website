abstract: 'We construct a supersymmetric vacuum of string theory in which the magnitude of the vacuum energy is $< 10^{-123}$ in Planck units. The mechanism that we introduce generates a well-controlled exponential hierarchy from an appropriate choice of the quantized parameters in the superpotential. Our approach provides a new angle on the cosmological constant problem.'
