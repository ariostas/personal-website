abstract: " We provide a user's guide to version 1.0 of the software package CYTools, which we designed to compute the topological data of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. CYTools has strong capabilities in analyzing and triangulating polytopes, and can easily handle even the largest polytopes in the Kreuzer-Skarke list. We explain the main functions and the options that can be used to optimize them, including example computations that illustrate efficient handling of large numbers of polytopes. The software, installation instructions, and a Jupyter notebook tutorial can be found at https://cy.tools."
