summary: ""
abstract: 'The Kreuzer-Skarke (KS) database has been an important wellspring of Calabi-Yau manifolds for string compactifications in the past two decades. Until recently, its formidable size and complexity have only allowed the base of this large Everest to be explored. Our computational advancements have now turned it into a playground that we can easily scout throughout. I will explain our developments, and present a live demo of our upcoming open-source package CYTools, which we hope will open the doors of the KS playground to everyone.'
