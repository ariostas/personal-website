summary: ""
abstract: 'Mirror symmetry has offered profound insights for physicists and mathematicians studying string theory and Calabi-Yau manifolds. However, computational tools have markedly lagged behind and cannot keep up with current needs. In this talk, I will present newly developed tools to compute Gromov-Witten and Gopakumar-Vafa invariants that greatly exceed available packages in efficiency and generality. I will showcase these capabilities and give examples of some of the insights they enable. Finally, I will talk about the wide range of phenomenologically-interesting applications that can now be accessed.'
