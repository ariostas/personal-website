My name is Andres Rios Tascon, and I am a graduate student pursuing a PhD in Physics at Cornell University under the supervision of Liam McAllister. My current research revolves around exploring compactifications of String Theory using computational algebraic geometry. I have developed powerful new tools to perform computations exponentially faster than with previously available software. I am the co-creator of CYTools; a package that makes my computational advancements available to the String Theory community. I am interested in a variety of topics ranging from constructing realistic string compactifications, to using machine learning methods to explore the string landscape.

In the past, I have worked on optimizing numerical techniques in Lattice QCD used to study properties of hadrons, and also on exploring possible measurements of Higgs couplings at future particle colliders.
