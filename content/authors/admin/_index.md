I am a Research Software Engineer at Princeton University, working with the Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP). I focus on developing tools needed to tackle the challenges posed by the high volume and complexity of the data that will be collected at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN and other future HEP experiments.
